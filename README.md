The goal of this project is to learn a new framework Vue.js.

Project specifics:
1) I used Vue.js for a whole project
2) I used Vuetify to build header and navigation
3) For everything else I used Bootstrap ...
4) ... and my favorite SCSS 

Covered use cases:
1) You can browse the Products, wich are loading from the external JSON source
2) You can add each and every Product unlimited times to the cart
3) There is a separate view for each Product, wich can be accessed by clicking on it
4) There is a separate view for the Cart content, where you can remove the Products from the Cart

Known issues:
1) I have added a category filter on main page but it's not working as expected. I'm still looking for the best solution for this one.
2) The site is not completely supporting the mobile version: the Cart counter which is shown upon Product addition to Cart is visible only on desktop.
